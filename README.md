# Analysing Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Trends Across India

## Overview
This project explores and analyses the trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption across different states in India. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of state-level EV sales, the analysis focuses on identifying key factors contributing to regional disparities in EV adoption. The insights derived from this study can aid in strategic decision-making for market planning, infrastructure investment, and policy development.

## Objectives
- Identify which states have the highest and lowest EV sales.
- Analyse the distribution of EV sales across various vehicle types and categories.
- Understand how the adoption of different vehicle types varies across states.
- Examine the evolution of EV sales over different years.
- Provide strategic recommendations for enhancing EV adoption across India.

## Dataset
**EV_Dataset.csv:** Contains state-level data on EV sales, including vehicle types and categories, offering a comprehensive view of EV distribution across Indian states.

**Key Features:**
- **State:** Names of Indian states with recorded EV sales data.
- **Vehicle Type:** Classifications of vehicles, such as two-wheelers and four-wheelers.
- **Vehicle Category:** Further classification into segments like commercial and passenger vehicles.
- **Electric_Vehicle_Sales_Quantity:** The number of EVs sold per state, essential for analysing adoption trends.

## Methodology
### Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

### Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensuring the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating summary statistics and visualizing the data to uncover trends and patterns.
3. **Visualization:** Creating bar plots, heatmaps, and line plots to illustrate key findings.
4. **Insights and Recommendations:** Drawing conclusions from the analysis and proposing actionable strategies to improve EV adoption.

## Key Findings
1. **Total EV Sales by State:** Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi  have the highest EV sales, while Ladakh, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim have the lowest.
2. **Distribution of EV Sales Across Different Vehicle Types:** Two-wheelers are the most popular, followed by three-wheelers and four-wheelers.
3. **Popularity of Vehicle Categories (Commercial vs. Passenger):** Passenger vehicles have significantly higher sales compared to commercial vehicles.
4. **Adoption of Different Vehicle Types Across States:** High variation in adoption patterns, with some states leading in specific vehicle types.
5. **EV Sales Over the Years:** A consistent upward trend in EV sales.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of EV adoption trends across India, highlighting regional disparities and offering strategic recommendations to boost EV sales. The findings can assist policymakers, market analysts, and businesses in making informed decisions to promote the adoption of electric vehicles.
